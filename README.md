## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS/Sass
- Flexbox
- CSS grid

### What I learned

In this simple challenge, I got to get some more practice with using grid and flexbox to create responsive layouts. I also learned about accessibility and tinted overlay for background images.

### Continued development

In the future, I would like to take on some more complex projects to really practice various grid layouts.

### Useful resources

For this challenge, I found a couple of resources particulary useful:

- [Article on dev.to](https://dev.to/chrissiemhrk/how-to-setup-sass-in-your-project-2bo1): This proved to be a very useful and clean checklist for setting up Sass that I've already used in a couple of projects.
- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/img_role): This was my main resource to learn about making an empty `<div>` with a background accessible.
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/tinted-images-multiple-backgrounds/): This article helped me figure out the easiest way to get the tinted background image.
